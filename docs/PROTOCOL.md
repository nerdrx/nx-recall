# recalld socket protocol — v1 draft

Unix domain socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nx-recall.sock`, mode 0600. No TCP.
Newline-delimited JSON, UTF-8, one message per line, both directions.

Design constraints this encodes (DESIGN §2, §8): protocol versioning is mandatory;
clients are dumb views that must survive daemon restarts; relabels are broadcast and
retroactive; long operations must not block other clients.

## Handshake

Client speaks first:

```json
{"hello": {"proto": 1, "client": "nx-recall-gui/0.1"}}
```

Daemon replies with its version and the current event sequence number:

```json
{"welcome": {"proto": 1, "daemon": "recalld/0.3", "seq": 41823, "schema": 2}}
```

If `proto` is unsupported the daemon replies `{"error": {"code": "proto", ...}}` and
closes. A client reconnecting after a daemon restart compares `seq`: if it is lower
than the client's last-seen (daemon restarted) or the gap exceeds the replay buffer,
the client does a full resync (re-runs its queries).

## Requests

```json
{"id": 7, "method": "search", "params": {"q": "portal world", "speaker": 12, "limit": 50}}
{"id": 7, "ok": {...}}                          ← exactly one terminal reply per id
{"id": 7, "err": {"code": "...", "msg": "..."}}
```

Methods (initial set):

| method | params | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sources.list` / `sources.set` | `{match_key, allowed}` | live toggle, no restart |
| `speakers.list` | | id, name, counts, total time |
| `speakers.name` | `{id, name}` | retroactive; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.merge` | `{from, into}` | tombstone, no chains; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.split` | `{id}` | **async op** (below); work completes inline — the reply carries the op handle **plus** the outcome: `{op, kept, minted, auto, moved_segments, moved_prototypes, ambiguous, centroid_similarity, embed_model_id, resync, seq}`. Data-driven refusals (one voice, golden conflict) come back as `err:refused`. The minted speaker's `relabel` carries `split_from`. Past ~100 changed rows the per-segment events are skipped and `resync: true` tells clients to re-query. |
| `segments.reassign` | `{segment_id, speaker_id}` | |
| `segments.correct` | `{segment_id, text}` | feeds anchor per DESIGN §5 |
| `search` | `{q, speaker?, source?, from?, to?, limit?}` | FTS now, +vec later |
| `transcript` | `{session?, speaker?, from?, to?}` | chronological page |
| `delete.preview` / `delete.run` | `{speaker?, session?, from?, to?}` | preview returns counts+bytes; run is an **async op** |
| `pause` / `resume` | | global capture pause (the panic path; must be instant) |
| `status` | | uptime, queue depth, drop counters, models loaded |

## Async operations

Long work (split re-cluster, bulk delete) returns immediately:

```json
{"id": 9, "ok": {"op": "op_412"}}
```

then progresses over the event stream (`op.progress`, `op.done`, `op.failed` with
the op id). Other requests keep flowing meanwhile.

## Events (pub/sub)

Subscribe: `{"id": 3, "method": "subscribe", "params": {"topics": ["segments", "relabel", "sources", "ops", "roster"]}}`.

Every event carries a monotonically increasing `seq`:

```json
{"seq": 41824, "ev": "segment", "data": {"id": ..., "session": ..., "speaker": ..., "text": ..., "overlap_frac": ...}}
{"seq": 41825, "ev": "relabel", "data": {"speaker": 12, "name": "Kira"}}
{"seq": 41826, "ev": "roster",  "data": {"ev": "join", "who": "...", "t": ...}}
```

`relabel` events mean: every view showing that speaker id updates in place — clients
never need to re-query for a rename. The daemon keeps a short replay buffer;
`{"method": "events.since", "params": {"seq": N}}` replays it or returns
`err: resync` if N has fallen out.

## Field conventions (v1 clarifications, born from the first real client)

- **Timestamps on events**: both `t_ms` (JSON number, ms since epoch — for display)
  and `t_ns` (JSON **string**, UTC nanoseconds — full fidelity exceeds 2^53).
- `status` is also a subscribable topic; the daemon pushes a `status` event on state
  change (pause especially). Clients may poll the method as well.
- `events.since` replies with the batch inline: `{"ok": {"events": [...]}}`.
  Clients dedupe by seq, so stream re-push is tolerated but the batch is canonical.
- `speakers.list` rows: `auto` (generated "Speaker_NN" label) alongside `name`
  (null until the user names them).
- `relabel` carries `merged_into` when caused by a merge. `delete.run` completion is
  followed by a `purge` event naming removed rows.
- `sources.list` rows: display name, binary, first_seen, last_seen, active streams.
- After any resync, clients rebase `lastSeq` onto the welcome/resync seq; the daemon
  guarantees `welcome.seq` reflects the live counter and subsequent events increase
  strictly from it.
- **Voice preview.** `segments.audio {id}` → `{id, wav_b64, duration_ms, sample_rate,
  bytes}`: that segment's stored WAV (16 kHz mono), standard padded base64 in the
  JSON frame. `err:not_found` = no such live segment (unknown id, or soft-deleted);
  `err:gone` = the row is still in the transcript but its audio is not (retention
  expired, or the file went missing) — the message says so, and a client must show it
  as a fact rather than a failure; `err:refused` = the file is over 10 MB, which no
  real segment is. `duration_ms`/`sample_rate` come from the WAV header, not the row.
- `speakers.sample {id, limit?}` → `{id, samples: [{segment_id, t_ms, t_ns,
  duration_ms, text, match_score}]}`: that voice's live segments **that still have a
  file on disk**, ranked longest-first (bucketed to whole seconds) then best-matched,
  `limit` default 3, max 20. It is the "play me this voice" query, so the naming flow
  does not page through transcripts. An empty `samples` is a valid answer (all of that
  voice's audio has aged out); an unknown speaker is `err:not_found`.
- **Frame budget**: one NDJSON line may reach 16 MB (`service::MAX_FRAME_BYTES`), the
  size the 10 MB audio cap can produce once base64'd. Clients MUST accept frames that
  large; a smaller guard drops the connection mid-reply instead of failing one request.

## Versioning rules

- `proto` bumps only on breaking changes; additive fields/methods/events are free.
- Clients MUST ignore unknown fields and unknown event types.
- The daemon MUST keep serving proto N−1 for one release after N ships (hub updates
  restart the daemon under a possibly-stale GUI — DESIGN §2).
