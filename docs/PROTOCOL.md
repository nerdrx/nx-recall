# recalld socket protocol — v1 draft

Unix domain socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nx-recall.sock`, mode 0600. No TCP.
Newline-delimited JSON, UTF-8, one message per line, both directions.

Design constraints this encodes (DESIGN §2, §8): protocol versioning is mandatory;
clients are dumb views that must survive daemon restarts; relabels are broadcast and
retroactive; long operations must not block other clients.

## Handshake

Client speaks first:

```json
{"hello": {"proto": 1, "client": "nx-recall-gui/0.1"}}
```

Daemon replies with its version and the current event sequence number:

```json
{"welcome": {"proto": 1, "daemon": "recalld/0.3", "seq": 41823, "schema": 2}}
```

If `proto` is unsupported the daemon replies `{"error": {"code": "proto", ...}}` and
closes. A client reconnecting after a daemon restart compares `seq`: if it is lower
than the client's last-seen (daemon restarted) or the gap exceeds the replay buffer,
the client does a full resync (re-runs its queries).

## Requests

```json
{"id": 7, "method": "search", "params": {"q": "portal world", "speaker": 12, "limit": 50}}
{"id": 7, "ok": {...}}                          ← exactly one terminal reply per id
{"id": 7, "err": {"code": "...", "msg": "..."}}
```

Methods (initial set):

| method | params | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sources.list` / `sources.set` | `{match_key, allowed}` | live toggle, no restart. `sources.set` **refuses** `match_key: "mic"` — see `mic.set` |
| `mic.get` / `mic.set` | `{enabled?, mode?}` | the microphone switch; live, no restart |
| `speakers.list` | | id, name, counts, total time, `languages` |
| `speakers.name` | `{id, name}` | retroactive; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.set_languages` | `{id, languages}` | which languages this voice speaks; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.prune` | `{apply?}` | list (default) or sweep the one-off voices |
| `speakers.merge` | `{from, into}` | tombstone, no chains; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.split` | `{id}` | **async op** (below); work completes inline — the reply carries the op handle **plus** the outcome: `{op, kept, minted, auto, moved_segments, moved_prototypes, ambiguous, centroid_similarity, embed_model_id, resync, seq}`. Data-driven refusals (one voice, golden conflict) come back as `err:refused`. The minted speaker's `relabel` carries `split_from`. Past ~100 changed rows the per-segment events are skipped and `resync: true` tells clients to re-query. |
| `segments.reassign` | `{segment_id, speaker_id}` | |
| `segments.correct` | `{segment_id, text}` | feeds anchor per DESIGN §5 |
| `search` | `{q, speaker?, source?, from?, to?, limit?}` | FTS now, +vec later |
| `transcript` | `{session?, speaker?, from?, to?}` | chronological page |
| `delete.preview` / `delete.run` | `{speaker?, session?, from?, to?}` | preview returns counts+bytes; run is an **async op** |
| `pause` / `resume` | | global capture pause (the panic path; must be instant) |
| `status` | | uptime, queue depth, drop counters, models loaded |

## Async operations

Long work (split re-cluster, bulk delete) returns immediately:

```json
{"id": 9, "ok": {"op": "op_412"}}
```

then progresses over the event stream (`op.progress`, `op.done`, `op.failed` with
the op id). Other requests keep flowing meanwhile.

## Events (pub/sub)

Subscribe: `{"id": 3, "method": "subscribe", "params": {"topics": ["segments", "relabel", "sources", "ops", "roster"]}}`.

Every event carries a monotonically increasing `seq`:

```json
{"seq": 41824, "ev": "segment", "data": {"id": ..., "session": ..., "speaker": ..., "text": ..., "overlap_frac": ...}}
{"seq": 41825, "ev": "relabel", "data": {"speaker": 12, "name": "Kira"}}
{"seq": 41826, "ev": "roster",  "data": {"ev": "join", "who": "...", "t": ...}}
```

`relabel` events mean: every view showing that speaker id updates in place — clients
never need to re-query for a rename. The daemon keeps a short replay buffer;
`{"method": "events.since", "params": {"seq": N}}` replays it or returns
`err: resync` if N has fallen out.

## Field conventions (v1 clarifications, born from the first real client)

- **Timestamps on events**: both `t_ms` (JSON number, ms since epoch — for display)
  and `t_ns` (JSON **string**, UTC nanoseconds — full fidelity exceeds 2^53).
- `status` is also a subscribable topic; the daemon pushes a `status` event on state
  change (pause especially). Clients may poll the method as well.
- `events.since` replies with the batch inline: `{"ok": {"events": [...]}}`.
  Clients dedupe by seq, so stream re-push is tolerated but the batch is canonical.
- `speakers.list` rows: `auto` (generated "Speaker_NN" label) alongside `name`
  (null until the user names them).
- `relabel` carries `merged_into` when caused by a merge. `delete.run` completion is
  followed by a `purge` event naming removed rows.
- `sources.list` rows: display name, binary, first_seen, last_seen, active streams.
- After any resync, clients rebase `lastSeq` onto the welcome/resync seq; the daemon
  guarantees `welcome.seq` reflects the live counter and subsequent events increase
  strictly from it.
- **Voice preview.** `segments.audio {id}` → `{id, wav_b64, duration_ms, sample_rate,
  bytes}`: that segment's stored WAV (16 kHz mono), standard padded base64 in the
  JSON frame. `err:not_found` = no such live segment (unknown id, or soft-deleted);
  `err:gone` = the row is still in the transcript but its audio is not (retention
  expired, or the file went missing) — the message says so, and a client must show it
  as a fact rather than a failure; `err:refused` = the file is over 10 MB, which no
  real segment is. `duration_ms`/`sample_rate` come from the WAV header, not the row.
- `speakers.sample {id, limit?}` → `{id, samples: [{segment_id, t_ms, t_ns,
  duration_ms, text, match_score}]}`: that voice's live segments **that still have a
  file on disk**, ranked longest-first (bucketed to whole seconds) then best-matched,
  `limit` default 3, max 20. It is the "play me this voice" query, so the naming flow
  does not page through transcripts. An empty `samples` is a valid answer (all of that
  voice's audio has aged out); an unknown speaker is `err:not_found`.
- **Frame budget**: one NDJSON line may reach 16 MB (`service::MAX_FRAME_BYTES`), the
  size the 10 MB audio cap can produce once base64'd. Clients MUST accept frames that
  large; a smaller guard drops the connection mid-reply instead of failing one request.

### The microphone (schema 4)

The user's own default input is a capture source like any other in the schema and
nothing like one in the consent model, so it is additive everywhere and never
folded into the allowlist.

- **`sources.list` rows carry `kind`**: `"app"` or `"mic"`. A client that does not
  know the difference must not render the microphone as an application — it hears
  the *room*, not one program, and its copy has to say so.
- **`sources.set` refuses `match_key: "mic"`** with `err:refused`, naming `mic.set`.
  The two would otherwise write to different halves of the config (`[rules]` vs
  `[mic]`) and disagree about a consent decision.
- **`mic.get`** → `{enabled, mode, active, state, device, you_speaker}`. `device` is
  the `[mic].device` pin (config-file only — a machine setup decision, not a click)
  or `null` for "follow the default source". `you_speaker` is the pinned speaker id,
  or `null` until the microphone has produced a segment.
- **`mic.set {enabled?, mode?}`** → the same block plus `persisted`. Both fields are
  optional and applied independently, so a client can change the mode without
  knowing whether the switch was already on. `mode` is `"follow"` or `"always"`;
  anything else is `err:params`, never a default. A call with neither field is
  `err:params`. The change is live *and* written to `config.toml`, so it survives a
  daemon restart; `persisted: false` means only the former.
- **`state`** is the one string worth printing, and there are five:
  `off`, `following:idle` (enabled, waiting for an allowed application),
  `following:active` (an allowed application is captured, so the room is being
  recorded), `always:active`, and `always:idle` — which means the switch is on in
  `always` mode and the daemon has not managed to open an input device. A missing
  microphone must never read as "recording".
- **`status`** carries `mic` (the same block, without `you_speaker`) and the flat
  `mic_state` string, plus `counters.mic_segments` / `mic_enrolled` / `mic_goldens`.
- **`mic` event**, on the existing **`status`** topic: `{"ev": "mic", "data": {...}}`,
  the same block. Published when the switch moves and when the capture thread opens
  or closes the stream — which is the only way a client can see a `follow`-mode
  transition, since nothing else in the protocol reports it. No new topic, so no
  client has to change its subscription and an older one ignores it under the
  versioning rule. There is deliberately **no** roster-style start/stop event beyond
  this: the segment stream already shows what is being recorded.
- **`speakers.list` rows carry `you`**: `true` for the pinned speaker the microphone
  labels, `false` for everyone else. Exactly one row can be `true`. It is not a
  match: segments from the microphone carry `speaker` with `match_score: null`,
  because there was no comparison to score. `overlap_frac` is still populated, so a
  client can still distrust the *audio* of a segment whose *name* is certain — which
  is what speakers-bleed looks like when the user runs loudspeakers.
- A **merge moves the pin.** `speakers.merge {from: <You>, into: <someone>}` leaves
  the tombstone a tombstone and re-points `you_speaker` at the target; the next
  microphone segment lands there. Merging in the other direction changes nothing.
  A second "You" is never minted.

### Per-speaker languages, provenance and storage (schema 5)

Three additive changes, all of them about the daemon saying *why* rather than
only *what*.

- **`speakers.list` rows carry `languages`**: a sorted array of BCP-47 tags
  (`["de"]`, `["de","en"]`) or `null`, which means *any* and is the default.
- **`speakers.set_languages {id, languages}`** → `{id, languages, seq}`.
  `languages` may be an array, a single string, or `null` / `[]` / `["any"]`,
  all three of which clear the declaration. Tags are lower-cased, de-duplicated
  and sorted, so one setting has one representation. Only `de` and `en` are
  accepted — the daemon classifies exactly those two, and a tag it cannot check
  is a correction it can never make; anything else is `err:params`. Broadcast on
  the existing **`relabel`** event, carrying `languages` *and* the current
  `name`, so a client folding it in never has to choose between the two facts.
  A `relabel` without a `languages` key says nothing about languages and must
  not clear them.

  What the declaration *does* is not symmetric, because the model catalogue is
  not. A voice pinned to exactly one language, and only such a voice, gets its
  transcripts checked against the text classifier. `en` + a German-looking
  transcript → the segment is decoded again with the English-only export, whose
  language is a property of the model rather than a hint; the new text replaces
  the old **only** if it is non-empty and reads as English, and `asr_model_id`
  moves with it. `de` + an English-looking transcript → there is no
  German-constrained decoder to re-run it with, so the words are kept and the
  row is marked. Either way the *speaker* is untouched: a voice does not become
  less recognisable by having been decoded in the wrong language.

  The declaration is load-bearing and a wrong one costs transcript quality: if
  a voice really does speak German and is declared English-only, the re-decode
  will replace good German with English-sounding nonsense. That is the honest
  consequence of a hard constraint, it is reversible (widen the languages), and
  it is why the default is `any` and the GUI copy says what each choice does.

- **Segment rows carry `lang` and `label_via`.** `lang` is the transcript's
  language when one is known — from the model when the model only speaks one,
  otherwise from the text classifier — and `null` when nobody could tell, which
  is a real answer. `label_via` is how the *speaker* got there:
  `"match"` (the voicebank), `"mic"` (provenance, never a comparison),
  `"manual"` (a person said so), or `"proximity"`. **A client must render
  `proximity` as uncertain**: that label was inherited from the confident turns
  either side of a fragment too short to identify, so it is a guess with a good
  reason rather than a measurement, and it carries `match_score: null`.

- **`speakers.prune {apply?}`** → `{apply, count, voices, ...}`. Without
  `apply` it lists and changes nothing: `voices` is `[{id, auto, name,
  segments, total_ms, speech_ns}]` for every voice with at most one segment and
  under three seconds of speech, plus `max_segments` and `max_speech_ms` so a
  client can explain the bar. With `apply: true` it deletes them — the segments
  are soft-deleted exactly as `delete.run` does them, so the undo window still
  applies, and the identity goes with its prototypes and goldens — and answers
  `{count, removed, segments}`. It **refuses the pinned "You" speaker and every
  named voice**, whatever the counts say. Each removed voice is announced as a
  `relabel` carrying `pruned: true`, which is *not* a merge: nothing moved
  anywhere, the id simply stops existing and its rows go back to nameless.

- **`status` carries `storage`**, or `null` before anything has measured it:
  `{db_bytes, audio_bytes, audio_files, goldens_bytes, models_bytes,
  total_bytes, measured_at_utc_ns}` — the last as a **string**, like every other
  nanosecond value on the wire. It is measured by the retention sweeper once per
  pass (and once at start-up), never by the `status` call itself: the status
  poll runs every three seconds in every open client and the answer costs a walk
  of the whole data directory. `null` means "not measured yet" and a client must
  render it as such; zeroes would be a claim about an empty disk.

- **`status.counters`** gains `too_slight` (turns that matched nobody and were
  under the mint bar), `proximity_labelled`, `redecoded` and `lang_mismatch`.

## Versioning rules

- `proto` bumps only on breaking changes; additive fields/methods/events are free.
- Clients MUST ignore unknown fields and unknown event types.
- The daemon MUST keep serving proto N−1 for one release after N ships (hub updates
  restart the daemon under a possibly-stale GUI — DESIGN §2).
