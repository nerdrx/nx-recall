# recalld socket protocol — v1 draft

Unix domain socket at `$XDG_RUNTIME_DIR/nx-recall.sock`, mode 0600. No TCP.
Newline-delimited JSON, UTF-8, one message per line, both directions.

Design constraints this encodes (DESIGN §2, §8): protocol versioning is mandatory;
clients are dumb views that must survive daemon restarts; relabels are broadcast and
retroactive; long operations must not block other clients.

## Handshake

Client speaks first:

```json
{"hello": {"proto": 1, "client": "nx-recall-gui/0.1"}}
```

Daemon replies with its version and the current event sequence number:

```json
{"welcome": {"proto": 1, "daemon": "recalld/0.3", "seq": 41823, "schema": 2}}
```

If `proto` is unsupported the daemon replies `{"error": {"code": "proto", ...}}` and
closes. A client reconnecting after a daemon restart compares `seq`: if it is lower
than the client's last-seen (daemon restarted) or the gap exceeds the replay buffer,
the client does a full resync (re-runs its queries).

## Requests

```json
{"id": 7, "method": "search", "params": {"q": "portal world", "speaker": 12, "limit": 50}}
{"id": 7, "ok": {...}}                          ← exactly one terminal reply per id
{"id": 7, "err": {"code": "...", "msg": "..."}}
```

Methods (initial set):

| method | params | notes |
|---|---|---|
| `sources.list` / `sources.set` | `{match_key, allowed}` | live toggle, no restart |
| `speakers.list` | | id, name, counts, total time |
| `speakers.name` | `{id, name}` | retroactive; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.merge` | `{from, into}` | tombstone, no chains; broadcasts `relabel` |
| `speakers.split` | `{id}` | **async op** (below) |
| `segments.reassign` | `{segment_id, speaker_id}` | |
| `segments.correct` | `{segment_id, text}` | feeds anchor per DESIGN §5 |
| `search` | `{q, speaker?, source?, from?, to?, limit?}` | FTS now, +vec later |
| `transcript` | `{session?, speaker?, from?, to?}` | chronological page |
| `delete.preview` / `delete.run` | `{speaker?, session?, from?, to?}` | preview returns counts+bytes; run is an **async op** |
| `pause` / `resume` | | global capture pause (the panic path; must be instant) |
| `status` | | uptime, queue depth, drop counters, models loaded |

## Async operations

Long work (split re-cluster, bulk delete) returns immediately:

```json
{"id": 9, "ok": {"op": "op_412"}}
```

then progresses over the event stream (`op.progress`, `op.done`, `op.failed` with
the op id). Other requests keep flowing meanwhile.

## Events (pub/sub)

Subscribe: `{"id": 3, "method": "subscribe", "params": {"topics": ["segments", "relabel", "sources", "ops", "roster"]}}`.

Every event carries a monotonically increasing `seq`:

```json
{"seq": 41824, "ev": "segment", "data": {"id": ..., "session": ..., "speaker": ..., "text": ..., "overlap_frac": ...}}
{"seq": 41825, "ev": "relabel", "data": {"speaker": 12, "name": "Kira"}}
{"seq": 41826, "ev": "roster",  "data": {"ev": "join", "who": "...", "t": ...}}
```

`relabel` events mean: every view showing that speaker id updates in place — clients
never need to re-query for a rename. The daemon keeps a short replay buffer;
`{"method": "events.since", "params": {"seq": N}}` replays it or returns
`err: resync` if N has fallen out.

## Versioning rules

- `proto` bumps only on breaking changes; additive fields/methods/events are free.
- Clients MUST ignore unknown fields and unknown event types.
- The daemon MUST keep serving proto N−1 for one release after N ships (hub updates
  restart the daemon under a possibly-stale GUI — DESIGN §2).
